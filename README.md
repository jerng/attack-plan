What is the Functional Programming form of every popular computer language? Would knowing this, make it easier to build new languages?

## drunk text (attack plan)^2

1. Make a list of all programming language features of interest.
2. Map each feature to >=1  functional programming forms, if possible.
3. Build a compilation graph that shows how to implement any feature from (2.) to C ( or some sort of abstract syntax tree ).
4. Declare spurious victory.
5. Show how various popular languages can be approximately modeled in (2.) and implemented via (3.)
